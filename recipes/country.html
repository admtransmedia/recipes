        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 300-degrees. Line a 9-inch by 13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil and 
                    spray with nonstick spray or olive oil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat the ribs dry with a paper towel and place them in the baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, add the seasonings, salt, black pepper, and brown sugar and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rub the mixture on all sides of the ribs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice the onion and place it on top of the ribs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the water into the pan and cover with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for two hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the end of two hours, take the ribs out and check for tenderness 
                (should be fork tender â€“ if not fork tender, replace the top aluminum foil and bake for 30 more minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                If tender, remove some of the water with a baster, 
                brush the barbecue sauce over the ribs, and bake again uncovered for one hour. Serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
